                To play the sports quiz, simply follow these steps to test your sports knowledge.
                Start by selecting your preferred difficulty level from the options: "Easy," "Medium," or "Hard."
                Each difficulty level offers a different level of challenge, so choose the one that suits your expertise. 
                Once you've made your selection, the quiz will begin. You'll be presented with a series of sports-related questions,
                each with multiple-choice answer options. Carefully read each question and click on the answer you believe is correct.
                If your answer is right, your score will increase, and you'll proceed to the next question. If you're unsure or make a mistake,
                don't worry; you can always learn from the questions and answers. Continue answering questions until you've completed the quiz 
                for your chosen difficulty level. After the final question, you'll receive your quiz results, including your score.
                Feel free to replay the quiz with different difficulty levels to challenge yourself and expand your sports knowledge.
                Enjoy the game and have fun testing your sports trivia skills!
