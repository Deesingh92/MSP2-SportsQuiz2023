## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Small switch palette from ColorSpace](assets/images/small-spot-palette.png)

The sports quiz uses this small spot palette, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%234059FD&sub=1), and generated from #4059FD, pulled from the logo colour chart above. I chose the color palette generated from #4059FD for my sports quiz website for several compelling reasons. This specific shade of blue, with its hexadecimal representation, exudes a sense of trust, reliability, and professionalism qualities that are essential for a sports-related platform. Additionally, blue is often associated with sports and athleticism, making it a natural choice. The palette's deep blue as the primary color conveys a sense of stability and calmness, providing an ideal backdrop for the quiz and information presented on the website. Moreover, the monochromatic variations of this blue, ranging from lighter tints to darker shades, allow for visual hierarchy and readability in the design, ensuring that users can easily navigate and engage with the content. Overall, this color palette not only aligns with the sports theme but also creates a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience for visitors to the site.



### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

#### Anton
- Bold and Attention-Grabbing: "Anton" is a bold and eye-catching font with thick, heavy strokes. It can instantly capture the viewer's attention and make important elements, such as headings and titles, stand out on the page. This can be particularly effective in a sports-themed website where you want to convey energy and excitement.

- Modern and Stylish: "Anton" has a modern and stylish appearance, which can give your website a contemporary and sophisticated look. This can be appealing to users who appreciate a trendy and visually pleasing design.

- Easy Readability: Despite its boldness, "Anton" maintains good readability, especially at larger font sizes. This ensures that your headings and titles remain legible and impactful, which is important for user engagement.

- Contrast: "Anton" can create a pleasing contrast when paired with a more straightforward and readable font for body text. This contrast helps in emphasizing key elements without sacrificing overall readability.

- Personality and Branding: Fonts play a significant role in conveying the personality and branding of a website. "Anton" can convey characteristics such as strength, excitement, and a sense of adventure, which may align well with the theme of sports and competition.

- Variety: Using "Anton" for headings and titles while using a different font for body text provides variety in typography, adding visual interest to your website's design.

#### Poppins

- Readability: "Poppins" is known for its excellent readability, making it a great choice for body text and other content where readability is crucial. Its clean and straightforward design ensures that users can easily consume information without strain.

#### Ubuntu

- Humanist Sans-Serif Design: "Ubuntu" is a humanist sans-serif font, which means it has a balanced and approachable design. This can contribute to a friendly and welcoming atmosphere on my website, making it more user-friendly.

- Readability: The font's design prioritizes readability, making it a suitable choice for body text and content-heavy sections of your website. Users can easily read and understand the text, which is essential for a quiz website where information is key.

- Neutral Aesthetic: "Ubuntu" has a neutral and unobtrusive aesthetic. It doesn't draw excessive attention to itself, allowing users to focus on the content and functionality of my website, such as the quiz questions and answers.

- Versatility: "Ubuntu" is a versatile font that works well in various design contexts. It can be used for both headings and body text, maintaining a consistent typography style throughout your website.

- The decision to use the "Ubuntu" font should align with the website's design goals and the user experience I wanted to provide. It's a practical and readable option that can contribute to a positive and user-friendly design.
