## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Small switch palette from ColorSpace](assets/images/small-spot-palette.png)

The sports quiz uses this small spot palette, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%234059FD&sub=1), and generated from #4059FD, pulled from the logo colour chart below.



### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

- 'Lato' for all text content across the website. This is a sans serif font.
I picked this particular font as it was suggested on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/#:~:text=Josefin%20Sans%20is%20an%20elegant>,One%2C%20Lato%2C%20and%20Playfair). The website states that 'Lato' would pair nicely with Josefins sans font, which is the primary font used for the logo on the home page. I wanted to keep it simple and consistent throughout the website, so opted for one style only to portray this.

### Imagery

All digital images in the results section, (excluding two images referenced in the [credit](#media) section), were taken by Clara Reynolds.
The [Seamless Pattern Leaves](assets/images/background-print-image-compressed.webp) for the left and right border across all pages, and the [Hiking Trail Sketch](assets/images/background-hiking.webp) featured in the 404 error page, were both downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). Content License allows users to use content for free and modify or adapt the content into new works.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

[Home Page - Desktop](docs/wireframes/home/home_page_desktop.png) |
[Home Page - Tablet](docs/wireframes/home/home_tablet.png) |
[Home Page - Mobile](docs/wireframes/home/home_mobile.png)

[Quiz Page (Answers) - Tablet](docs/wireframes/quiz/quiz_answers_tablet_.png) |

[Map Page - Desktop](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_desktop_.png) |
[Map Page - Tablet](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_tablet_.png) |
[Map Page - Mobile](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_mobile_.png)

The final website design has maintained the simple structure as shown in the wireframes, with a few minor changes here and there. I wanted to keep the design quite minimalistic as I wanted to focus more on implementing javascript code to the Quiz and Map page.

### Features

The website consists of three pages, all of which are accessible from the navigation menu throughout the website. A custom 404 error page is also available if a user were to land on it.

*All pages on the website have:*

- A responsive navigation bar and navigation links across the header from left to right as followed - Home, Quiz, Map. On a mobile device, the navigation bar switches to a dropdown menu, taken from [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/dropdowns/), so that it is easier to view and navigate on a smaller screen.
- When hovered over, each navigation link will change colour from black to a cream colour (used from the [small switch palette](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)), to show what page the user is about to navigate to.
- The footer consists of a headline encouraging users to connect with the website's Instagram page, followed by a font awesome icon underneath of the recognisable Instagram logo. When the icon is clicked on, this opens up in a separate browser to www.instgram.com. When hovered over, this link displays the beige colour again, keeping in theme with the small switch palette. There is copyright centered beneath the icon in a small font size.
- Both header and footer contain a natural green/brown colour, pulled from the small switch palette as well.

*Home Page:*

- The home page is a simple and elegant design, featuring a logo that I custom created on [Logo.com](https://logo.com/). The logo image includes a green silhouette of two trees inside a white silhouette of mountain tops, inside a matching green circle. Underneath this a slogan that reads “Discover South Wales” in green, with a tag-line of “Unveiling Nature's Treasures” directly below this. The logo is scaled down to fit mobile devices as well.
- Underneath the logo are two heading titles with the questions “Visiting South Wales for the first time?” and “Ready to start exploring the great outdoors?”. These two headings are short and simple, designed to address the users needs of venturing to the area for the first time.
- Below this I've added a simple div containing a discrete line that splits the page into 2 sections; the heading and quiz information.
The quiz heading instructs  the user to take a short quiz on where to go. This is accompanied with a clear 'Start Quiz' button that navigates the user to the Quiz page. When hovered over the button creates a smooth transition from a green background to a mixture of green and brown, keeping in theme with the colour of the header and footer.

*Quiz Page:*
Our sports quiz is not just a game; it's a journey through the exciting world of sports knowledge.
