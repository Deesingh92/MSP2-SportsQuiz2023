## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Discover South Wales is a website designed for potential first time visitors with limited knowledge of rural areas to explore. It's a simple design, centered round a short quiz, and it aims to give users a quick guide on where to go. By asking a set of 5 questions based on what the user's preferences are, the website acts as a personal guide, presenting one of eleven locations based on the user's results that would be well suited to the answers the user gives.

There is an additional Map page, which gives the user an overall view of the suggested locations within South Wales. This also allows the user to explore more options if they are not satisfied with the recommendation from taking the quiz.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Small switch palette from ColorSpace](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)

Discover South Wales uses this small switch palette, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23096A2E&sub=1), and generated from #096A2E, pulled from the logo colour chart below.



### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

- 'Lato' for all text content across the website. This is a sans serif font.
I picked this particular font as it was suggested on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/#:~:text=Josefin%20Sans%20is%20an%20elegant>,One%2C%20Lato%2C%20and%20Playfair). The website states that 'Lato' would pair nicely with Josefins sans font, which is the primary font used for the logo on the home page. I wanted to keep it simple and consistent throughout the website, so opted for one style only to portray this.

### Imagery

All digital images in the results section, (excluding two images referenced in the [credit](#media) section), were taken by Clara Reynolds.
The [Seamless Pattern Leaves](assets/images/background-print-image-compressed.webp) for the left and right border across all pages, and the [Hiking Trail Sketch](assets/images/background-hiking.webp) featured in the 404 error page, were both downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). Content License allows users to use content for free and modify or adapt the content into new works.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

[Home Page - Desktop](docs/wireframes/home/home_page_desktop.png) |
[Home Page - Tablet](docs/wireframes/home/home_tablet.png) |
[Home Page - Mobile](docs/wireframes/home/home_mobile.png)

[Map Page - Desktop](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_desktop_.png) |
[Map Page - Tablet](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_tablet_.png) |
[Map Page - Mobile](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_mobile_.png)

The final website design has maintained the simple structure as shown in the wireframes, with a few minor changes here and there. I wanted to keep the design quite minimalistic as I wanted to focus more on implementing javascript code to the Quiz and Map page.

### Features

The website consists of three pages, all of which are accessible from the navigation menu throughout the website. A custom 404 error page is also available if a user were to land on it.

*All pages on the website have:*

- A responsive navigation bar and navigation links across the header from left to right as followed - Home, Quiz, Map. On a mobile device, the navigation bar switches to a dropdown menu, taken from [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/dropdowns/), so that it is easier to view and navigate on a smaller screen.
- When hovered over, each navigation link will change colour from black to a cream colour (used from the [small switch palette](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)), to show what page the user is about to navigate to.
- The footer consists of a headline encouraging users to connect with the website's Instagram page, followed by a font awesome icon underneath of the recognisable Instagram logo. When the icon is clicked on, this opens up in a separate browser to www.instgram.com. When hovered over, this link displays the beige colour again, keeping in theme with the small switch palette. There is copyright centered beneath the icon in a small font size.
- Both header and footer contain a natural green/brown colour, pulled from the small switch palette as well.

*Home Page:*

- The home page is a simple and elegant design, featuring a logo that I custom created on [Logo.com](https://logo.com/). The logo image includes a green silhouette of two trees inside a white silhouette of mountain tops, inside a matching green circle. Underneath this a slogan that reads “Discover South Wales” in green, with a tag-line of “Unveiling Nature's Treasures” directly below this. The logo is scaled down to fit mobile devices as well.
- Underneath the logo are two heading titles with the questions “Visiting South Wales for the first time?” and “Ready to start exploring the great outdoors?”. These two headings are short and simple, designed to address the users needs of venturing to the area for the first time.
- Below this I've added a simple div containing a discrete line that splits the page into 2 sections; the heading and quiz information.
The quiz heading instructs  the user to take a short quiz on where to go. This is accompanied with a clear 'Start Quiz' button that navigates the user to the Quiz page. When hovered over the button creates a smooth transition from a green background to a mixture of green and brown, keeping in theme with the colour of the header and footer.

*Quiz Page:*

- When the user navigates to the quiz page they are greeted with the first question with instructions to select one of 3 answers below. When the answers are hovered over by the user the background colour disappears, and when the user selects an answer, it is highlighted in the green/brown mixture, indicating that this has been selected. This was put in place instead of radio buttons, so the user has a greater range to click on, rather than just aiming for a small radio button. A user may click between answers before deciding to move onto the next question. If a user doesn't select an answer and selects the 'next' button, an alert pops up urging the user to select an answer.
- When the next button is hovered over, this too changes to a green/brown colour signifying to the user to click next.
- Over the next set of questions, the initial instructions are removed. At the last question the user is greeted with a submit button, styled in the same way as the next button.
- When the user submits their answers, the quiz questions are replaced all together with one of eleven possible results. These results are structured in the following order:
  - A title featuring “Based on your recommendations, we recommend…”
  - Place name title
  - A brief description of what to expect
  - An accompanying image of the location
  - A link that opens up an external website in a separate window, giving the user more in depth detail about the hike and navigation. When the link is hovered over the background colour changes to white.
- Beneath the results there are two short, but informative headlines. These signify to the user that if they're not happy with their recommended result they can navigate over to the maps page to explore more options. The navigation link is represented by a font awesome icon of a map/marker, which when hovered over changes from green to green/brown.
- This is separated by a line divider, and underneath this there is an option for the user to start the quiz over if they wish to do so. This is represented in the familiar button style marked as 'Start over', keeping in theme with the rest of the website. By clicking this button, the user is taken to the first mutliple choice question again.

*Map Page:*

- The Map page can be accessed via the navigation link Map, or the font awesome map icon when the user receives their recommended results on the quiz page.
- This page features Google Maps, centered on South Wales with eleven markers numbered 1 - 11. Each marker, when clicked on once will display the name of the marker's location. When double clicked, this also takes the user to an external website in a separate window, with more details on the location. The user is able to zoom in and out, and move around the maps, to explore each marker available.
- If, due to poor internet connection, the maps are loading slowly, I've implemented simple loading dots just below the navigation bar, to indicate to the user that the maps are loading.
- Above the Google Maps are simple instructions, represented with an 'information' font awesome icon ('i'), telling the user to “Click the map markers to view place names, and double click them for more information”. This gives the user clarity on how to navigate through Google Maps.

*404 Error Page:*

- The 404 page Features a print of a figure walking through the hills with a couple of trees. This image is sandwiched between two informative headings reassuring the user that they can navigate back to the home page (featured at the bottom), to continue using the website.

*Future Implementations:*

- Future goals include creating an Instagram page that allows users to share images of where they have been, tagging @DiscoverSouthWales or #DiscoverSouthWales, for a chance to get their photo featured on the official Instagram page. This will encourage new users to stumble across the Instagram page, in turn leading them to this website to participate in the quiz.
- I want to add more place results, and potentially replace old ones, so that returning users can continue exploring other places to go. In order to decide which places are to be replaced, I would collect the quiz results data and determine which results were coming up the least, replacing these with new suggestions.
- I want to be able to extend the quiz, asking further questions, so that the user gets an even more specified result, tailoring to their outdoor wants and desires.

### Accessibility

I have ensure that this website is as accessible friendly as possible, I have done the following to achieve this:

- Used semantic HTML.
- Used visually hidden text to describe background images in CSS, where an alt attribute cannot be supplied.
- Included aria-label for website navigation to describe to the screen reader where the user is being taken to.
- Used alt attributes to images in HTML to describe them.
- Using the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) colour contrast checker to ensure all body text is legible with sufficient contrast.
